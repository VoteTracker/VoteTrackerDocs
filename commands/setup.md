# Setup

## Step 1

Tell the bot what server or bot you want to track.  
To do this you use the command `vt!setup <guild id or bot id>`

{% hint style="info" %}
 Your id can be found in your top.gg link

Example: [https://top.gg/bot/702134514637340702](https://top.gg/bot/702134514637340702). The id would be 702134514637340702
{% endhint %}

## Step 2

Set up the bots configuration. To find more information about this take a look at the [Config](config.md#usage) page.

## Step 3

Now you need to update the data on top.gg so we receive data about your votes. For this you go to your pages edit page.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can find your edit page by adding `/edit` after the url of your top.gg page
{% endhint %}
